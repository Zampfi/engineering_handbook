                    <p>It is of extreme importance to us that we get the best people on board Zamp. The time that a
                        candidate spends with
                        Zamp is precious. We are comitted to respect the candidates time and ensure they have the best

                <ul>
                    <li>Interviewer is always expected to keep the camera on unless there is a network issue or there is
                        no reciprocation from the candidate.</li>
                    <li>In case of a no show, please wait for 10 mins, before dropping off and informing the recruiter.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you need to reschedule, please let the know recruiter well in advance. In case of last minute
                        reschedules, please inform the recruiter and the candidate about your urgency.</li>
                    <li>Treat each candidate with dignity and respect. Does not matter how they behave. No one from Zamp
                        will ill treat any canidate.</li>
                    <li>We close loop with 100% candidates.</li>
                    <li>A new Interviewer is instated on the panel only after 4 shadow and 2 reverse shadow rounds.</li>
                    <li>The structure of each interview is the same. A 60 minutes call divided into - introduction,
                        problem and ask me anyting sections.</li>

                <p>Each canidate interviewing at Zamp will go through the same process irrespective of the domain of
                    expertise or seniority. Some cadidates maybe fast tracked or asked to do more rounds as per
                    discreetion
                    of the recruitment team. <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLmtycS-CokOxIkrNuuqkpdXX33hcVW6svBBhbzKqKU/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110640268207678841741"

                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1 - Screening. Once a candiadte applies, their CV lands up on our pipeline. Recruiters and
                        managers go through the CVs and shortlist CVs which are a good fitment for Zamp.</li>
                    <li>Step 2 - Intro Call. Recruiters setup a 30 mins chat with the candidate to understand their
                        intent and growth path.</li>
                    <li>Step 3 - Coding Round 1. This is generalised for all candidates. The candidate is expected to
                        code in this round. The metrics of judgement are problem solving, coding, performance analysis
                        and communication skills. It is expected that the candidate can structure an ambiguos problem
                        statement, break it into tasks, prioritise them and come up with a solution. The solution needs
                        to be codified in a language of their choice. It is important that the candidate writes modular
                        code adhering to common design patterns. The candidate should be able to talk about performance
                        metrics of their own solution and what could have been done better. We do not ask generic
                        LeetCode questions. However, you do need concepts of datastructures to perform well in this
                        round. Interviewers are expected to rate the candidate on all these parameters out of 10. Post
                        which, the recruiter takes a call on how to move forward the candidate.</li>
                    <li>Step 4 - Coding Round 1. This is generalised for all candidates. The candidate is expected to
                        code in this round. The metrics of judgement are problem solving, coding, performance analysis
                        and communication skills. It is expected that the candidate can structure an ambiguos problem
                        statement, break it into tasks, prioritise them and come up with a solution. The solution needs
                        to be codified in a language of their choice. It is important that the candidate writes modular
                        code adhering to common design patterns. The candidate should be able to talk about performance
                        metrics of their own solution and what could have been done better. We do not ask generic
                        LeetCode questions. However, you do need concepts of datastructures to perform well in this
                        round. Interviewers are expected to rate the candidate on all these parameters out of 10. Post
                        which, the recruiter takes a call on how to move forward the candidate.</li>
                    <li>Step 5 - Coding Round 2. This is domain specific round. For backend engineers, you can expect a
                        mixture of HLD and LLD. For frontend engineers, you can expect an assignment followed by a demo
                        and Q&A round. For devops and QA engineers, you can expect a domain expert to go deep in your
                        area of expertise. The candidate can expect deep questions about their past expiriences. The
                        interviewer is expected to judge the candidate on the parameters of their past expirience,
                        domain expertise, system design, communication skills and how well they can grow. The
                        interviewer will provide a rating out of 10 on all these parameters. The recruiter will decide
                        the next steps as per the score.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 6 - Get to kow your manager and let your manager get to know you! Crisp 30 mins chat.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 7 - Get to know the founder, the vision and let the founder know you.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 8 - Debrief!
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 9 - Offer
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 10 - Welcome on board Zamp!
                    </li>
